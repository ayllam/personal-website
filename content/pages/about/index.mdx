# about me

Australian/UK hands-on technological inventor & entrepreneur who splits his time between Asia and Europe. Proud global citizen.

Culture and heritage shape us. Firm believer in the values of humanity and individuality. Drive to learn is the core of my life.

I love to build and get my hands dirty. I'm passionate about anything that helps break status quo. Especially in the space of DAOs and gig economies.
